# step-by-step-cpp

üëã Welcome to my programming journey!

This repository tracks my step-by-step progress as I learn programming, starting with **C language fundamentals**, moving through **C++ and Object-Oriented Programming**, then diving into **Data Structures and Algorithms**, and gradually preparing for **competitive programming** and **advanced topics**.

Everything is organized cleanly into folders based on topic and progression.

## üìò Introduction to Programming with C

This section builds the foundational programming concepts using the **C language**.

It covers:
- Basic syntax and structure
- Conditional statements
- Loops and nested loops
- Arrays and array operations
- Strings and string operations
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers
- 2D arrays and recursion patterns

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è C++ for Data Structures and Algorithms

After learning the basics of C, I moved on to **C++**, which is essential for implementing efficient data structures and writing clean code using object-oriented techniques.

This section includes:
- C++ syntax and basic concepts
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Classes and objects
- Working with strings
- Arrays of objects
- Practice problems using C++

## üå≥ Introduction to Data Structures (with C++)

This folder focuses on the **fundamentals of data structures** implemented using **C++**.  
Each topic is organized with explanations, code, and related practice problems.

### Topics covered:
- Time Complexity & Space Complexity  
- Linear Search, Binary Search, Selection Sort  
- Two Pointers & Prefix Sum  
- Singly Linked List  
- Doubly Linked List  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Priority Queue  
- Binary Tree  
- Binary Search Tree (BST) & Heap

## ‚ö° Introduction to Algorithms (with C++)

This folder focuses on **fundamental algorithms** and their implementation using **C++**.  
Each algorithm includes explanations, code, and practice problems from online judges.  

### Topics covered:
- Basics of Graph  
- Breadth First Search (BFS)  
- Depth First Search (DFS) and 2D Grid  
- Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm  
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm  
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm  
- Dynamic Programming  
- 0-1 Knapsack and Variations  
- Unbounded Knapsack and Variations  
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) DP and Variations  
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)  

---

## üß† Problem Solving Practice

I solve problems from online judges like **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, **Leetcode**, **Codeninjas** focusing on each data structure as I learn them.

Problems are stored in the respective folders (e.g., arrays, linked lists) so that theory and application stay together.

## üéØ Goal

My goal is to build a strong foundation in C/C++, understand data structures deeply, and gradually prepare myself for competitive programming and software engineering interviews.

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning log
- A reference for revision
- A roadmap for beginners who want to follow a similar path
