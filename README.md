# step-by-step-cpp

üëã Welcome to my programming journey!

This repository tracks my step-by-step progress as I learn programming, starting with **C language fundamentals**, moving through **C++ and Object-Oriented Programming**, then diving into **Data Structures and Algorithms**, and gradually preparing for **competitive programming** and **advanced topics**.

Everything is organized cleanly into folders based on topic and progression.

## üìò Introduction to Programming with C

This section builds the foundational programming concepts using the **C language**.

It covers:
- Basic syntax and structure
- Conditional statements
- Loops and nested loops
- Arrays and array operations
- Strings and string operations
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers
- 2D arrays and recursion patterns

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è C++ for Data Structures and Algorithms

After learning the basics of C, I moved on to **C++**, which is essential for implementing efficient data structures and writing clean code using object-oriented techniques.

This section includes:
- C++ syntax and basic concepts
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Classes and objects
- Working with strings
- Arrays of objects
- Practice problems using C++

## üå≥ Introduction to Data Structures (with C++)

This section is the core of my current focus. It includes the implementation of essential data structures and algorithms using **C++**. Each topic is organized into its own folder with explanation, code, and practice problems.

Topics covered so far:
- STL Vector
- Prefix Sum and Binary Search
- Singly Linked List (and various operations)
- Doubly Linked List
- STL List and cycle detection
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)
- Trees and Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Hash Maps and Hash Sets
- Tries
- Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree
- Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
- Practice problems related to each topic (Codeforces & others)

## üß† Problem Solving Practice

I solve problems from online judges like **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, **Leetcode**, **Codeninjas** focusing on each data structure as I learn them.

Problems are stored in the respective folders (e.g., arrays, linked lists) so that theory and application stay together.

## üéØ Goal

My goal is to build a strong foundation in C/C++, understand data structures deeply, and gradually prepare myself for competitive programming and software engineering interviews.

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning log
- A reference for revision
- A roadmap for beginners who want to follow a similar path
